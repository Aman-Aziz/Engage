# Engage
Project
1. In scheduler only one html page so browser back button should not be used. Rather back button is provided in the screen.
2. In Live Discussion Rooms chat messages are not stored on database. So, if person can only view chat messages that were sent/received when the person was present in the room. Time in Chat Room is London Time.
3. In registry option provide your actual email ID to sign in using "Google Sign in". By default class preference is Online Mode when a new student record is created.
