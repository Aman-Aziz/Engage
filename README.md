# Engage
Project

1. Wherever a "Back Button" is provided on the screen, it should be used to go to the previous screen instead of the browser's default back button.
2. In "Live Discussion Rooms", chat messages are not stored on a database. So, a person can only view chat messages which were sent/received when the person was present in the room. Time in Chat Room is London Time.
3. In the "Registry" option, provide your actual email ID to sign in using "Google Sign in". By default, class preference is Online Mode when a new student record is created.
