# Engage
Project
1. Scheduler: One html page so browser back button should not be used. Rather back button is provided in the screen.
2. Chat: 
  a. If someone refreshes the screen their username disappears for now.
  b. Chats and Users are not stored on database. So, if person can only view chat messages that were sent/received when he was present in the room
  c. Time in Chat room is London Time.
