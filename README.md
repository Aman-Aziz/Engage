## NOTES:

1. Only Admin can register a student. In the "Registry" option,  to get admin access. Use credentials - USERNAME: admin PASSWORD: admin. 
2. In "Live Discussion Rooms", chat messages are not stored on a database. So, a person can only view chat messages which were sent/received during the session.
3. Wherever a "Go Back" Button is provided on the screen, it should be used to go to the previous screen instead of the browser's default back button.
4. While registering a student, provide an actual email ID to sign in using "Google Sign in". By default, class preference is Online Mode when a new student record is created. 
5. One faculty is already registered. EmailID: akashgoel2021@gmail.com PASSWORD: AkashEngageGoel. Use this emailID-password combination to check faculty interface.
