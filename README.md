# Engage
Project


1. Only Admin can register a student. In the "Registry" option, use credentials - USERNAME: admin PASSWORD: admin to get Admin access. 
2. In "Live Discussion Rooms", chat messages are not stored on a database. So, a person can only view chat messages which were sent/received during the session.
3. Wherever a "Back Button" is provided on the screen, it should be used to go to the previous screen instead of the browser's default back button.
4. While registering a student, provide an actual email ID to sign in using "Google Sign in". By default, class preference is Online Mode when a new student record is created.
